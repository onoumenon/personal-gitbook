### Mean, Median, Mode

Mean: Average of the set. If the set = \[2, 4, 5\], then the average is \(2+4+5\)/3.

Median: Midpoint value of a data set, where a equal number of samples is _less than_ and _greater than_ the value. If the set = \[1, 3, 4, 5, 9\], then the median is 4.

Mode: Element\(s\) that occur most frequently in a data set. If the set is \[1, 3, 3, 3, 4, 6, 7, 7, 9\], then the mode is 3.

### Precision & Scale

Precision: Number of significant digits. \(eg: 0.012345 and 12.345 have a precision of 5\)

Scale: Number of significant digits to the right of a decimal point. \(eg: 0.12 and 1.23 both have a scale of 2\)
