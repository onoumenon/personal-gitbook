Hi, I'm Hui Tian, a mid-career switcher \(from artist to web developer\). I like learning new things, but the mind is [forgetful](https://www.iflscience.com/brain/being-forgetful-may-mean-your-brain-is-actually-working-properly/), and this is my way of preserving my knowledge.

Other things I like: good food, science fiction, and cats.
