# CS Fundamentals

{% hint style="info" %}
I recommend CS50 by Harvard (it's free!) if you're a maths/ com-sci noob like I was. It's engaging, and challenging without being overwhelming. Afterwards, you can pick a roadmap depending on your goals/ interests. I'm going with OSSU since the roadmap is clear-cut and open source.
