# Semantic versioning

{% embed url="https://semver.org/" %}

### TLDR

Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

1. MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
2. MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and
3. PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.

This should be used in conjunction with your Release flow/ CI so that Release cycles are well documented.
