# Cloud Computing Fundamentals

Standard definition of cloud by NIST:

* On-demand self service (no need for human interaction)
* Broad network access (avail over network through standard mechanism, like HTTP, SSH, etc)
* Resource pooling (utilize economy of scale, has location independence, resources are pooled using a multi-tenant model)
* Rapid elasticity (automated elastically provisioned, appear unlimited)
* Measured service (monitor, controlled, reported and billed)

Public cloud includes aws, azure and google.

If you use more than one provider for your system, it'd be multi-cloud. Only if you need the resilience.

Stay away from single management window. You will lose unique features and only the basic feature set is available. (Cos this third party tool will need to abstract the features and can only offer the features avail across all their providers)

Private cloud only if you use these offerings from the providers

If you use both aws and aws outposts, it's a hybrid cloud.

{% hint style="info" %}
Hybrid cloud MUST be fully cloud. On-premise physical servers + public aws is considered a hybrid environment.
