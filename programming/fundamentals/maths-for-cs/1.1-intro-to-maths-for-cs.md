# 1.1 Intro to Maths for CS

The curriculum covers

* Fundamental concepts of discrete mathematics \(sets, relations, proof methods\)
* Discrete Mathematical Structures \(numbers, graphs, trees...\)
* Discrete Probability Theory

### Mathematical Proofs

Eg: Pythagorean theorem \(a \*\* 2 + b \*\* 2 = c \*\* 2\)

Rearrange the shapes into:

1\)  a c \* c square  
2\) an a \* a & b \* b square

![Second squares of a \* a and b \* b](../../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2835%29.png)

Pictorial proofs are cool, but they can be worrisome due to hidden assumptions \(eg: right angled triangles\)
