# Start Here

## Web Development Starter Kit \(2019\)

There are plenty of resources. Pick any and stick with it if it works for you. I personally found [P1xt's guide](https://github.com/P1xt/p1xt-guides/) useful as a road map. There are [other](https://roadmap.sh/) road maps as well, and resources for [self-learning](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) [CS](https://teachyourselfcs.com/).

Start with [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) and/or [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) for basic type-along HTML/ CSS/ JavaScript. It's simple and in bite-sizes, ideal for people who have other commitments. If you have more time or find this boring, skip to something more challenging. There's no need to finish all the FCC curriculum.

{% hint style="info" %}
Pick either. Free Code Camp offers more, and has a bigger community. If you already know basic HTML/ CSS/ JavaScript, skip them.

[CS50 by Harvard](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science) teaches basic Computer Science concepts. Highly recommended. You don't need to complete the final project.

[Learn Enough](https://www.learnenough.com/) \(GIT, IDE, Command Line\), because the sooner you know them, the more comfortable you will be with developer tools. Commit to your own git repositories and use the IDE and command line for all future projects.

For basic JavaScript knowledge, skim read MDN's documentation and [Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/). Don't worry if you don't understand anything on first read.

[FullStackOpen](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) or [App Academy](https://open.appacademy.io/) or [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses?ref=homenav) to learn full stack development. App Academy has videos and I would recommend them over Odin Project. Ruby on Rails may be less popular nowadays but is still pretty big, so you can replace that with NodeJS if you prefer \(depending on the jobs available in your country\). 

Pick a specialization based on interest \(refer to [P1xt's guide](https://github.com/P1xt/p1xt-guides/) for resources\).

[HackDesign 101](https://hackdesign.org/lessons101) to learn Web Design, if you are going into front-end web development.

The bootcamp I graduated from also has a good guide available here:
