## Optimizing the Mac experience

## The Toolbox

### Terminal

Download [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/downloads.html)

Download [Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh) (with zsh-autosuggestions plugin)

`brew install git`

Download node version manager: [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)

Download node (using `nvm install node`)

{% embed url="https://opensource.com/article/19/5/python-3-default-mac" %}

Download python version manager: [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)

Download latest ver of python using pyenv&#x20;

Now that Python 3 is installed through pyenv, we want to set it as our global default version for pyenv environments:

```
$ pyenv global 3.7.3
# and verify it worked
$ pyenv version
3.7.3 (set by /Users/mbbroberg/.pyenv/version)
```

The power of pyenv comes from its control over our shell's path. In order for it to work correctly, we need to add the following to our configuration file (**.zshrc** for me, possibly **.bash\_profile** for you):

```
$ echo -e 'if command -v pyenv 1>/dev/null 2>&1; then\n  eval "$(pyenv init -)"\nfi' >> ~/.zshrc
```

### VSCode for the IDE
