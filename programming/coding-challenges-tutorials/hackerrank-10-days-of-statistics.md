# Hackerrank 10 days of Statistics

## Day 0

### Mean, Median, Mode

Mean: Average of the set. If the set = \[2, 4, 5\], then the average is \(2+4+5\)/3.

Median: Midpoint value of a data set, where a equal number of samples is _less than_ and _greater than_ the value. If the set = \[1, 3, 4, 5, 9\], then the median is 4.

Mode: Element\(s\) that occur most frequently in a data set. If the set is \[1, 3, 3, 3, 4, 6, 7, 7, 9\], then the mode is 3.

### Precision & Scale

Precision: Number of significant digits. \(eg: 0.012345 and 12.345 have a precision of 5\)

Scale: Number of significant digits to the right of a decimal point. \(eg: 0.12 and 1.23 both have a scale of 2\)



## Day 1

### Standard Deviation

To calculate the Variance, take each difference, square it, and then average the result:

| **Variance** |  |  |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| σ2 | = | _2062 + 762 + \(−224\)2 + 362 + \(−94\)2_**5** |
|  | = | _42436 + 5776 + 50176 + 1296 + 8836_**5** |
|  | = | _108520_**5** |
|  | = | 21704 |

So the Variance is **21,704**

And the Standard Deviation is just the square root of Variance, so:

| **Standard Deviation** |  |  |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| σ | = | √21704 |
|  | = | 147.32... |
|  | = | **147** \(to the nearest mm\) |

### Probability

Probability of an event happening = _Number of ways it can happen /_ Total number of outcomes

## Day 4

### Binomial Distribution

Formula: n! / \(k!\(n-k\)!\)

Resource: [https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/binomial-distribution.html](https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/binomial-distribution.html)

Assumption: the chances of success or failure are **equally likely**.
