## About Me

[Portfolio ](http://onoumenon.netlify.com)| [Github ](https://github.com/onoumenon)| [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hui-tian/)

Hi, I'm Hui Tian, a mid-career switcher (from artist/designer to software developer).

I graduated from the ThoughtWorks Jumpstart! software development bootcamp ([click here](https://www.thoughtworks.com/jumpstart) to learn more about the program), and am currently working as a full-stack developer.

I like learning new things, but the mind is [forgetful](https://www.iflscience.com/brain/being-forgetful-may-mean-your-brain-is-actually-working-properly/), and this is my way of preserving the stuff I know.

Other things I like: science fiction, anime, design, perfumery and bubble tea. ðŸ§‹

## How to Use

Predominantly, this is used to log/ store what I've learned for Programming. You can follow my journey by going through Programming Core linearly or use the search function.&#x20;
