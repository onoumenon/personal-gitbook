## IDE

Historically, we had to use several software programs \(a text editor, a compiler, a linker, and operating system commands\) to make the conversion and run our program. However, today all those software programs with their associated tasks have been integrated into one program. However, this one program is really many software items that create an environment used by programmers to develop software. Thus the name: Integrated Development Environment or IDE.

IDEs available: Atom, VSCode, Eclipse, VIm, etc

## Version control

Refer to [GIT](../git/)

Every task done on the computer happens inside the central processing unit \(CPU\) and the associated memory. Once our program is loaded into memory and the operating system directs the CPU to start executing our programming statements the computer looks like this:

Our program, now loaded into memory, has basically two areas:

* Machine instructions – our instructions for what we want done
* Data storage – our variables that we're using in our program

## Casing standards

Almost all programming languages and most coding shops have a standard code formatting style guide programmers are expected to follow. Among these are three common identifier casing standards:

* camelCase - each word is capitalized except the first word, with no intervening spaces
* PascalCase - each word is capitalized including the first word, with no intervening spaces
* snake\_case - each word is lowercase with underscores separating words
* kebab-case - each word is connected together with a dash-line just like a skewer.

C++, Java, and JavaScript typically use camelCase, with PascalCase reserved for libraries and classes. C\# uses primarily PascalCase with camelCase parameters. Python uses snake\_case for most identifiers. Kebab case is used in Perl 6 language, but it is also used in URLs of websites. In addition, the following rules apply:

* Do not start with an underscore \(used for technical programming\)
* CONSTANTS IN ALL UPPER CASE \(often UPPER\_SNAKE\_CASE\)

These rules are decided on by the industry \(those who are using the programming language\).
