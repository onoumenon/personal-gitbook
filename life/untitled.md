# How to choose a career

## Axioms

1. You often develop [passion ](https://bigthink.com/mike-colagrossi/why-following-your-passion-could-leave-you-broke-and-frustrated)for a subject when you get good at it. You also tend to get good at something you are passionate about.
2. Try everything\* and fail fast. Get out there and talk to people even before you commit to a career choice.
3. Financial security is essential for most people to be happy. It also tends to be [relative](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/20/how-much-money-you-need-to-be-happy-according-to-wealth-experts.html).
4. [Meaningful jobs](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/news/minds-business/a-meaningful-job-linked-to-higher-income-and-a-longer-life.html) tend to be [social](https://www.realsimple.com/work-life/life-strategies/job-career/meaningful-work), with high positive impact, fair rewards and [autonomy](https://open.buffer.com/meaningful-work/).
5. Jobs are an irrevocable part of our capitalistic society, and there are unequal opportunities.

\*Except stupid things. Like drugs or getting your junk stuck in a toaster.

## Ikigai

The Japanese concept '[Ikigai](https://medium.com/thrive-global/ikigai-the-japanese-secret-to-a-long-and-happy-life-might-just-help-you-live-a-more-fulfilling-9871d01992b7)' refers to "a reason for being."

The modern conception of 'ikigai', as the diagram above shows, is a distillation of the concept. I personally find it too moderate. The assumption that you should find a middle ground disregards individual differences in priorities and opportunities. 

Given that we spend about half our waking hours in a job, choosing a career can be an existential question. It's why when asked "What do you do?", most of us default to our job titles. 

The reality for most people is that a job just pays the bills. Ignoring economic realities when talking about finding[ a job you love](https://junkee.com/lets-talk-immense-privilege-struggle-love/93679) paints an incomplete picture. 

Your priorities, the job market, and opportunities change with time. You shouldn't base your identity on your career. I think the barometer of a good career choice is how much value it brings to your and others' lives.
