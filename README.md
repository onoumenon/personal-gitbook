## About Me

[Portfolio ](http://onoumenon.netlify.com)\| [Github ](https://github.com/onoumenon)\| [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hui-tian/)

Hi, I'm Hui Tian, a mid-career switcher \(from artist/designer to web developer\).

I graduated from the ThoughtWorks Jumpstart bootcamp, and here's their guidebook if you're interested in getting into software development: [https://guides.jumpstart.sh/\#/](https://guides.jumpstart.sh/#/) 

I like learning new things, but the mind is [forgetful](https://www.iflscience.com/brain/being-forgetful-may-mean-your-brain-is-actually-working-properly/), and this is my way of preserving the stuff I know.

Other things I like: good food, bubble tea, science fiction and anime.

## How to Use

Predominantly, this is used to log/ store what I've learned for Programming. You can follow my journey by going through Programming Core linearly, or use the search function.
