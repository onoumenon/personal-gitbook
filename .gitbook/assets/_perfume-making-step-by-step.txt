PERFUME MAKING STEP BY STEP

This is a guide for the newbies. You will learn how
to make perfume step by step. It's a combination of
some selected files to create a simple overview, with
some important information added. 





                           How to build a perfume
                             
A perfume contains:
* Fragrance
* Alcohol
* Water

The fragrance materials are for example essential oils but 
also synthetics. First we work only with the natural materials.

Essential oils
--------------
You can buy these in special natural shops and also online. 
Don't use the perfume oils because they are not the same 
they are not natural and mostly based on heavy oils.

Alcohol
-------
For perfume the ethyl alcohol is the best because this 
alcohol doesn't have a smell of its own. You also can 
use the cheaper Denatural alcohols but they have a 
smell of their own. These alcohols are cheaper because 
they put something in it so you can't drink the alcohol 
anymore. You can dillute the alcohol with distilled water. 
To a 80% alcohol for example.(see file: Alcohol based perfume)

A perfume is build up from
--------------------------

*Topnotes
These oils have lighter molecules so when you smell 
a perfume you will smell the topnotes first. 
Topnotes are:
Bergamot, Lemon, Petit grain, Orange, Lemongrass etc

*Heartnotes
These oils give there fragrance after the topnote. 
Heartnotes are:
Rose, Jasmin, Tuberose, Ylang Ylang, Clove, Lavender etc.

*Basenotes
Basenotes comes at last, they have a long staying power and 
help the perfume stay longer on the skin.
Basenotes are:
Cedar, Sandalwood, Benzoe, Olibanum, Tonka bean, Patchouli, 
Oakmoss etc


Let's get started
-----------------

From each group (top, heart, base) you choose at least one 
or more oils.

Now you start to blend.

Start with the base notes, for example use 5 drops. Than 
you blend the heartnotes and at the end the topnotes.

Start with a simple formula, don't use too much diffirent oils. 
You can use 15-20 drops in 5 ml alcohol(80%) or if you like 
jojoba oil.

Now you will take another bottle and use the same oils like 
before but in a total other way. For example more Ylang Ylang 
than you used before.

Give the bottles a number and writhe the formula down. Let the 
bottles stay for three weeks (I know, I know) so the perfume can 
mature. After three weeks the perfume smells different than when you 
first made it.

Let your fantasy go and learn the smell of your oils.
To learn the smell of your oils you can put one drop on a paper 
and smell the oil every hour. So it's also clear that it's maybe 
a top or a base note. Write the time down how long it stay 
on the paper.

Here some tips:

* In stead of alcohol you also can use jojoba oil. The smell 
would be really different try it some time.

* Citrus oils can be phototoxic so don't use too much when you 
go outside in the sun

* Never use the essential oils pure on your skin make sure you 
dilute it first. Some oils are very powerful.

* Use diluted oils. For example dilute Lemon or Ylang etc 
with alcohol to a 10% (10% oil and 90% alcohol)
so you can use a touch of lemon or Ylang 
in stead of one whole drop. So you don't have to make a lot of 
perfume to get the same result. I dilute my oils in a 
small 10 ml bottle with a pipette. Some have 1% some 5% 
and some 10 to 25 %.

I'm new to perfumery what do I need to get started?

First of all welcome to the world of perfumery, an 
exciting world where you can explore your creativity.

I would recommend to go through all the files for 
all kinds of information, a lot of your questions would
be answered there. Also the Links sector contains a lot
of information.

You first need to decide what kind of perfume you would
like to make; a perfume based on alcohol(see the file: 
Alcohol based perfume) or oil(jojoba) or maybe
a solid perfume. Do you want to make an all natural perfume
or do you want to make a perfume based on natural oils and
aroma chemicals.

If you already have some essential oils you could start right
away, but if you haven't you have to buy them first. In the
course "How to make perfume"(can be found in the files sector)
you can find all the information about how to start. Some 
important essential oils to start with are:
Lemon
Orange
Bergamot
Ylang ylang
Geranium
Lavender
Clary sage
Rose absolute(real expensive)
Jasmine absolute(real expensive)
Clove
Black pepper
Patchouli
Cedar
Sandal 
Benzoin
Frankinsence(olibanum)

To read more about essential oils see the file:
"Essential oils used in perfume".

If you like to use aroma chemicals there are some places on
the web where you can buy them in small quantities like:
http://www.perfumersworld.com/
and:
http://www.thegoodscentscompany.com/
and:
http://www.perfumersapprentice.com
(is also a member of the group and sell aroma chemicals
in small quantities from IFF, Givaudan etc)
If you life in Europe you can buy some basic
aroma chemicals from Omrikon a company in Germany:
http://www.omikron-online.de/

But not all chems could be found there. There are some important
companies that sell aroma chemicals like IFF, Givaudan, Quest,
Symrise etc you can find them in the Links sector in the folder:
"Suppliers of aroma chemicals". The only problem is they sell by
kilos sometimes you need to buy 10 kilo of one item. That's why 
we do group buys(see the file: "Group buys") so we all buy it 
together.

Short starting list for aroma chemicals

This is a short 'starting list' if you want to experiment
with aroma chemicals for the first time. This short list 
contains important aroma chemicals to start with:

Hedione
Galaxolide
Methyl Ionone
Alpha Ionone
Beta Ionone
Benzyl Salicylate
Benzyl acetate
Phenylethyl alcohol
Iso E Super
Coumarin
Linalool

With this list you already can start experimenting a lot.
If you like to buy more aroma chemicals you could think of

Amyl salicylate
Aldehyde C11 undecylenic
Lyral
Geraniol
Citronellol
Terpineol alpha
Muscone
Heliotropin
Exaltolide
Vertofix
Nerol
Eugenol

How to dilute an alcohol of 95% to another per cent.


90 per cent alcohol may be prepared by diluting 947 ml 
of 95 per cent alcohol with water to 1000 ml.

80 per cent alcohol results from diluting 842 ml 
of 95 per cent alcohol to 1000 ml.

70 per cent alcohol is obtained by diluting 737 ml 
of 95 per cent alcohol; 60 per cent by diluting 632 ml, 

50 per cent by diluting 526 ml, 
and 45 per cent by diluting 474 ml to 
1000 ml with purified water.

To dilute alcohol you always use volume not weight.

Diluting your materials

You can dilute your materials with for example alcohol 
to say a 10% dilution(9 parts alcohol and 1 part of the material). 
I always keep that in 10ml bottles with pipettes. You can 
make dilutions of 20% or 10% etc depending on the materials, 
when you use for example aldehyde you will dilute it to a 1% 
to a 3% because it's a strong powerful material. This way you 
can use smaller parts of the material. 

If you make a perfume you will use a lot of materials it can 
be from 30 to even 100 materials. You start with a base accord 
(say about 5 to 7 materials)what will act as a starting point 
for your perfume. To build the perfume you will need smaller 
parts of other materials sometimes even diluted to a 1% to give 
just a tiny effect without overpowering the base accord. When 
you don't use dilutions you will have to use a really big 
amount of the "base accord" to get the same result what 
will be very expensive. 

For example: you will make an accord that needs 
bergamot 500 
Aldehyde C10 3
lemon 10 
rose 700
clove 20
ylang ylang 150
sandal 450
musk 100

This would be:
bergamot 5
Aldehyde C10 1% 3 (3 gram or 3 drops of a 1% dilution)
lemon 10% 1 (1 gram or 1 drop of a 10% dilution)
rose 7
clove 10% 2
ylang ylang 1,5 (1,5 gram or 1 drop ylang and 5 of a 10% dilution)
sandal 4,5
musk 1

Better work with weight instead of drops

The accord that used diluted materials is much cheaper, 
you don't need as much of the materials this way.
Another reason to dilute a material is to study the 
material because diluted the smell can be different 
than pure.

Other solvents you can use are:
Dipropylene Glycol (D.P.G.)
Isopropyl Myristate (I.P.M.)
Diethyl Phthalate (D.E.P)
Benzyl Benzoate (B.B)

Scales

If you want to make perfume in a professional way you need
to weight your materials. You need a digital scale that 
is 0.01 sensitive. These scales are really not that expensive,
especially if you buy a 100 gram scale to start with, later
you can buy a larger scale.

You'll need a scale because if you would work with volume,
you'll never know the weight of the materials. 1 ml bergamot
will not weight the same as 1 ml sandalwood, so the formula
would not work. Suppose the formula would be like this:

Bergamot 4
Rose 0.5
Ylang Ylang 2
Sandalwood 2
Cedarwood 3
Musk 2.5

This formula is in weight, so the bergamot 4 in this case means
4 grams. Rose 0.5 means a half gram, Ylang Ylang 2 means 2 grams
etc.

Of course you can multiply the amount. Say you want to make more
perfume with this forumal, then you mulitply it with say
10. Then the formula would look like this:

Bergamot    40 grams
Rose         5 grams
Sandalwood  20 grams
Cedarwood   30 grams
Musk        25 grams 

If you would use volume instead of weight, so instead of 40 grams
Bergamot you would use 40 ml Bergamot, and instead of 5 grams Rose
you would use 5 ml Rose, the proportion/ratio would not be the same 
as meant in the original formula. Namely the materials all have their
own weight. 40 ml Bergamot would not weight the same as 40 ml Rose. 

If there is used a % in the formula like this:

Aldehyde C12 3% 10

It means that the Aldehyde is first diluted to a 3% and that 10 grams
of this diluted material is used in the formula.

If you want to dilute a material, you use weight as well. You weight the
material and the solvent you use, which can be alcohol or dipropylene glycol
or any other material. For example, if you want to make a 3% dilution, you use
3 grams of the material plus 97 grams of the solvent (alcohol or DPG etc).

Synthetic fragrance materials



In the past perfumers only used natural ingredients for perfumes.
These ingredients were, and still are, very expensive. Only rich 
people could pay for perfume in that time.

In the 19th century chemici discovered that it was possible to 
extract some fragrance compounds from essential oils. To get 
an important fragrance compound for Rose they extracted 
geraniol from lemongrass or palmarosa. These were cheaper 
than the oil of rose. This way they were able to create a 
cheaper rose smell.

A rose absolute has different molecules that all give their 
own scent. It is not just one molecule that makes the rose 
smell like rose but something like 300 or much more different 
fragrance compounds. 


Example of some of the compounds of a rose absolute:

Rose                                                                   

Phenylethylalcohol
Geraniol
Citronellol
Linalool
Rhodinol
Farnesol
Eugenol
etc etc etc

To compare a list of some of the compounds of geranium, what 
smells a bit like rose:

Geraniol
Linalool
Pineen
etc etc

Nature does make perfume of it's own. With all kinds of 
formulas. You will find the same compounds in different 
plants. Another example:

Orange                                                     

Limoneen
Linalool                                                           
Dipenteen
Terpineol                                                              
Geraniol                                                               
Citral
Citronellal

Here you can see that there are certain similarities, but 
the compounds are mixed in a different combination 
togheter with other compounds.

Now an impression on how the compounds smell

Geraniol-rosy fresh
Linalool-woody soft rosy 
Limoneen-citrus
Eugenol-clove
Phenylethyl alcohol-rosy sweet but also sharp.

But the chemists went a step further. In stead of 
extracting fragrance compounds from plants, they started 
to make the compounds themself. They made them by 
synthesizing petrolle or coal. That way they made 
Benzaldehyde that smells like almond but also coumarin 
that smells like hay and Vanillin that smells like vanilla.

That way they could make much cheaper perfumes. It also was 
possible to make scents that doesn't occure in nature. Here some 
other examples of synthetic fragrance compounds:

Lilly of the valley-Hydroxycitronellol
Musk-Galoxide
Violet-Methyl Ionone
Sugar-Maltol
Peach-Aldehyde C14
Lilac-Alpha Terpineol

In 1889 Guerlain used a blend of Vanillin-Coumarin and 
linalool for his perfume Jicky, that made his perfume famous. 
By using synthetics the perfumes changed, these perfumes smelled 
different than the perfume made only from natural ingredients. 
They became more perfumy and totaly new.

Learn your materials

Smell your materials as often as you can on smelling strips(pure and
diluted) and on your skin (diluted of course). This is very important! 
Smell the materials during the whole day and see how it chance. Write 
your impressions down. 

Try to recognize your materials. What you can do is to put some of 
your materials each on different smelling strips and try to recognize
them blindly. You can also ask someone else to choose some materials
for you and let him put it on smelling strips. This is a fun game
to recognize your materials.

You can also put some of these smelling strips together in your
hand like a fan, and smell their combination. Put one of them aside 
and smell it again, put it back and smell the effect this material 
has on the combination of the materials.

The concentration of the fragrance compounds in alcohol 


Perfume
Perfume, parfum(french) extract or extrait are all 
the same; it means that the perfume contain about 
20 to 30 % (sometimes even higher)fragrance concentrate 
with an alcohol of 90%. The perfume or extrait contain 
expensive natural oils, in the cheaper eau de parfum or 
eau de toilette the expensive materials are replaced by 
cheaper materials.

Eau de parfum
Eau de parfum contain 15 to 25 % fragrance concentrate 
with an alcohol of 80% (sometimes higher)

Eau de toilette
Eau de toilette contain 10 to 20 % fragrance concentrate 
with an
alcohol of 80% For men's fragrance the percentage is 
mostly a bit lower. After shave contain about 4% 
fragrance concentrate.

Eau de cologne
Eau de cologne contain 5 to 10% fragrance concentrate 
with an alcohol of 80%

Eau fraiche

same fragrance concentrate as a cologne(5 to 10%) 
but with an alcohol of 90%.

There is a difference between the french and american 
perfumes, american perfumes have more fragrance concentrate.

This is just a rough explanation of the different 
fragrance strength.

notes are part of accords. Accords are perfectly balanced 
notes that gives a complete new note. It’s like you blend 
a yellow and blue color. Together it will be a green color. 
For example if you mix the fragrances of fresh cut grass, 
sugarcane, butter and ripe apples you get a strawberry smell, 
but only when you use the right proportions. On the next pages 
you will see some different accords of perfumes.

Classical Perfume

"A classic perfume is determined by the quality of 
the raw materials you put in it and by its elegance, 
distinction and originality", Guerlain says…."Above 
all it has to be memorable".

Every perfumer is influenced by the work of other 
perfumers before him and will add something new 
to it. In perfumery, there are no real standard 
rules but there are some principles that can 
help guide us.

It is important to learn from the work of the 
great masters. It's a way to discover how aromas 
work together. The best way to learn the 
principles of how aromas work, together, is by 
re-creating their work.

By re-creating the work of the master perfumers, 
you can get an idea of what the "master" thought, 
why he used certain notes and why he combined 
them in a certain way.

Through experience, you learn how aromas react 
to one another. By studying the classic, famous, 
perfumes you already have one-step up in 
experience because you know now why the perfumer 
had used certain notes.

By knowing the perfume families and studying the 
classics, you gain a great advantage in perfumery, 
something you can use for finding your own style 
and method when making a perfume.

In this lesson, we will study the classic perfumes:
L'air du Temps, Chanel no 5, Shalimar and Femme

We will find out what kinds of notes are used in 
these perfumes as well as some more background 
information about them. In order to re-create 
these fragrances, we will need the information 
about what types of notes they may contain; 
we will then need to compare our creations 
to the original fragrance.

Analyzing scents:

We try to find the notes in the 
Classic perfumes by the information
we will be reading, later on in this lesson. 
Another way of detecting the notes in 
these perfumes, is by smelling them on our 
skin and on scent-strips as well . 

It takes a lot of concentration to discover 
the notes of a perfume. You can ask yourself 
questions like: "do I smell clove or is it 
another spicy note I smell", "does this fragrance 
contain lemon or is the citrus note coming from
Bergamot or neroli", "do I smell phenylethyl 
alcohol or is it geraniol" etc.

After you've discovered a certain note you need 
to put that note aside and then smell around that 
already discovered note, to detect  the other
notes of the fragrance.  On the next page, you can 
find some tips on how to smell and compare the 
classic perfume to your own re-creation.

Some smelling tips:

*After you have discovered a note and smelled it 
intensely you can make your nose tired (fatigued)of 
that note thereby eliminating that note from the 
perfume, now you can smell the other notes around it.

*The same method can be used when you want to compare 
your re-creation with the original. When your nose 
gets tired of the notes from the original, it can 
then detect the notes in your re-creation, that do 
not belong in there.

*Another way to discover the components of a classic 
perfume is by using two scent strips, one strip is 
made later than the other strip, so you might detect 
a note that no longer exists on the first strip, yet 
can still be detected on the newer one. This way you 
can distinguish the top, heart and base notes.


It is also important to smell the base notes from 
the original, you can do this by using a smelling 
strip and leaving it for a couple of hours or even days.
    
Another way to find out if a particular note exists 
in the original perfume, is by putting an individual 
note on a smelling strip (e.g. bergamot) and then 
comparing the scent of that strip with the strip that 
contains the original perfume.

When you, for example, used clove in your re-creation 
of the original, but  have doubts that it exists in 
the original, you can use two smelling strips, one 
with the original and one with your re-creation, then 
by smelling the two strips, without knowing which one 
you are smelling. When you can smell clove in one of 
them but not the other, you are probably right, that 
it doesn’t belong in there.

Try not to concentrate too much on one aspect.

Let’s expand further on the classic perfumes, we will 
start with  

L'air du Temps

L'air du Temps was launched in 1948 by Nina Ricci, 
and was created by perfumer Francis Fabron. The 
magnificent bottle was designed by Marc Lalique.
L'air du Temps is a floral, salicylate fragrance, 
Nigel Groom describes the notes as:

Top: Bergamot, Carnation, Rose
Heart: Gardenia, Jasmine, Rose, Orris root, Ylang Ylang
Base: Musk, Iris, Sandalwood

But, what is really inside L'air du Temps? Lets have
a closer look at the ingredients...... 

In the book: "Practice and principles of perfumery" 
it says that L'air du Temps contains a Carnation 
complex made of Benzyl Salicylate and Eugenol at a 
ratio of 4.5 to1 respectively, with the formula 
containing 15% Benzyl Salicylate. The Carnation complex 
also contains Ylang Ylang and iso-Eugenol. 
    
The base has an accord made of Methyl Ionone(10%) 
Vetiveryl Acetate, Sandalwood, Musk Ketone and 
Musk Ambrette, the base notes along with the Carnation 
complex, is the main accord of this fragrance. 

The heart contains a bouquet of floral notes reduced 
to their simple components: Terpineol for Lilac, 
Styrallyl Acetate for Gardenia, Phenylethyl Alcohol 
for Rose, Hydroxycitronellol for Muguet and 
Benzyl Acetate and Amyl Cinnamic Aldehyde for Jasmine.

The top notes (14% of the formula) are a classic mix 
of Bergamot and Rosewood together with their components 
Linalool and Linalyl Acetate.

The richness and complexity of this fragrance is coming 
from Jasmine and Rose absolutes.
 
To the basic structure of the fragrance as it stands now, 
there are added in small amounts the following materials:
Aldehyde C11 undecylenic, gives impact and blends 
beautifully with Styrallyl Acetate, it also works as a 
bridge between the top notes and the rest.
Vanilla, Heliotropin and Iris complement the Carnation 
complex. Vanilla adds some impact,  but it must 
used carefully.

So how can we use this information? We can begin by 
making a copy of L'air du Temps and then by analyzing, 
or better yet, smelling what the perfumer Francis Fabron 
may have thought when he created  it, why he used 
certain notes in combination. We can then alter this 
formula. We can do this by, for example, replacing 
some of the known materials with other (newer) materials. 

Many perfumers were inspired by L'air du Temps and 
created fragrances that had similar notes, but used 
other notes to replace some of them, like in the perfume: 
             
Fidji by Guy Laroche(1966) 

The Benzyl Salicylate is replaced by cis 3 Hexenyl 
Salicylate and the Hydroxycitronellol is replaced 
by Lyral. 

In the perfume
Paris by Yves Saint Laurent(1983)

The Carnation complex is replaced by a Violet and 
Rose complex. In L'air du Temps the Methyl Ionone 
works as a woody-iris character in combination with 
Vetiveryl Acetate, while in “Paris” it works as the 
basis for a Violet accord in combination with 
iso E Super as the woody note.

Chanel no. 5

Chanel no. 5 was launched in 1921 and was created 
by the perfumer Ernest Beaux. It's a floral aldehydic 
fragrance. Chanel 5 utilizes Lemon and Bergamot along 
with synthetic aldehydes, used possibly for the 
first time, in amounts larger than usual and larger 
than those found in nature. Natural oils like citrus 
oils do contain Aldehydes but never in such a high content. 
There is a story that the assistant to Ernest Beaux, 
who prepared the formula, created by Ernest Beaux, made a 
mistake and used 10 times more of the Aldehydes than was 
supposed to be used. The result was so refreshingly new 
that Ernest kept the formula as it was.

Nigel Groom describes the notes as:

Top: Ylang Ylang, Neroli, Aldehydes
Heart: Jasmine, Rose, Iris, Lilly of the Valley
Base: Sandalwood, Vetiver, Musk, Vanilla, Civet, Oak moss

The top notes of Chanel no. 5 contain Bergamot, Linalool, 
Linalyl Acetate, Neroli and Aldehydes (1%).
 
The heart notes contain a high percentage (4 to 5%) of Rose 
and Jasmine absolutes. It also contains 8% Methyl Ionone, 
10% Hydroxycitronellal, Cinnamic Alcohol, iso Eugenol, 
Ylang Ylang, Rose alcohols(Geraniol, Citronellol etc) 
and a little Phenyl acetaldehyde. 
   
The base notes contain Ciste oil, natural Musk, Amber grey, 
Civet, Styrax, Vetiveryl Acetate, Sandalwood, 5 % Coumarin, 
1.5% Vanilla and 10% Nitro Musks.

We do not actually know which Aldehydes or Musks were used 
in Chanel no. 5

When we read the book, “The Emperor of Scent” by Chandler Burr, 
we can read that Aldehydes with less than seven carbon atoms 
have an unpleasant smell, but above seven they have a 
pleasant smell and can be used as perfume ingredients. 
The Aldehydes with an even number of carbon atoms have a 
citrus-like scent but the Aldehydes with an odd number of 
carbon atoms smell waxy and candle-like. 

The secret to Chanel no. 5 was that Ernest Beaux used a 
large amount of the even-numbered Aldehydes like 
Aldehydes; C8, C10 and C12 and just a small amount of the 
uneven Aldehydes, like Aldehyde C11.

On the Internet you can find what kinds of musks 
Chanel no. 5 contains, for instance, it contains a high 
amount of Musk Ketone followed by Galaxolide, a bit of 
Tonalide and Musk Xylene among others.


Rive Gauche by Yves SaintLaurent(1971) 

is an aldehydic perfume as well, where the
rose complex dominates the fragrance with an accent 
on Geranium and Aldehydes. It contains 15% of the 
following combination of materials:

Cyclamen Aldehyde, Muguet, Hedione and Hexylcinnamic 
Aldehyde, it also contains Coumarin and Musk ketone, 
Cedarwood 2% and Kephalis.

Femme
                       
Femme, was launched in 1945 by Rochas. It was created 
by the perfumer Edmond Roudnitska. Femme is a
fragrance that belongs to the Chypre family.

Nigel Groom describes the notes as:

Top: Peach, Plum, Apricot, Bergamot,
     Cinnamon
Heart: Jasmine, Rose, Immortelle, Ylang
       Ylang
Base: Oak moss, Sandalwood, Patchouli, Musk,
      Amber, Vanilla

Femme contains a high percentage of fresh top notes 
like: Bergamot, Lemon, Petit Grain (Citronnier). 
It has a fruity Jasmin note, Oak moss, Methyl Ionone, 
Patchouli and Labdanum.

Edmond Roudnitska used small amounts of woody 
materials, fruity notes of bases like Prunol or 
de Laire, as well as Balsams and spicy notes like 
Cumin and Cardamom.
   
He also used a Carnation base, which contains Eugenol, 
iso Eugenol, Heliotropin and Ylang Ylang. The fragrance 
also contains a lilac note and Opopanax (sweet Myrrh).

Cabochard by Gress(1958)

has similar notes as Femme but instead of the
fruity notes of peach and apricot, there are more green 
top notes used by Galbanum and Basil. The heart notes 
contain a lily note from Hydroxycitronellal. Instead 
of a lilac note, a Gardenia note is introduced by using 
Styrallyl Acetate together with Aldehyde C11 undecylenic, 
much the same as was used in L’air du Temps. The base 
contains most of the same notes as in Femme but there 
are also some leather notes used, like iso Butyl Quinoline.

Miss Dior(1947)

does contain some similar notes found in Femme, 
only doesn’t have the fruity notes, instead 
they used Galbanum (as used in Cabochard) and
Styrallyl acetate combined with Aldehydes such as; 
Aldehyde C11 Undecylenic, and Aldehyde C10. 

Where the spicy notes in Femme were Cumin and 
Cardamom, in Miss Dior they used Pepper and Coriander. 
Miss Dior contains Hydroxycitronellal as does Cabochard, 
though newer versions contain the substitute 
Lyral (Hydroxycitronellal being a skin sensitizer).

Shalimar

Shalimar was launched in 1925 by Guerlain. It was 
created by the Perfumer Jacques Guerlain. It is
an oriental perfume. It was inspired by an 
Indian Emperor’s love for his magnificent wife. 
Shalimar is named after The Gardens of Shalimar, 
where their love grew and flourished. 

Top notes: Bergamot, Mandarin, Cedar, Lemon
Heart notes: Patchouli, Jasmine, Rose, Orris
Base notes: Vanilla, Benzoin, Peru Balsam, Leather

Shalimar has a high percentage of natural, animal 
and balsamic notes. The formula contains 
3% Ethyl Vanillin and 9% Coumarin. The top contains 
30% Bergamot, other citrus notes, Neroli, and rosewood.

It is based on the Ambrein accord which contains: 
Bergamot, Vanilla, Coumarin and Civet. Besides the 
Ambrein accord it contains 4% Patchouli, Sandalwood 
and Vetiver. 

For the leather note, Jacques used Castoreum and a 
leather base, like Cuir de Russie and a small amount 
of Cinnamon bark oil to complement the leather notes. 
He also added a peach note by using Aldehyde C14. 

For the rose notes, he used Rose absolute, Citronellol 
and Geraniol. Then, tinctures of Vanilla, Tonka, Benzoin, 
Civet, Castoreum, Amber grey and Musk, were employed.

Must de Cartier (1981)

is also based on the Ambrein accord with additions 
of Coumarin, Vanilla (vanillin) and Civet. It also 
contains Sandalwood, which together with Hedione and 
Galaxolide takes up 40% of the formula. A bit of 
Cedryl Acetate was then added to the sandalwood. 
For the green-fruity notes, they used Triplal and 
Aldehyde C14, Galbanum and a little bit of Thyme oil.
