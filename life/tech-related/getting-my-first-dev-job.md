# Getting my first dev job

I'll be sharing my own developer journey at a CodingGirls sharing session held at ThoughtWorks (along with my female ex-classmates). So this is a public copy of my notes.&#x20;

### Background

About 7 months ago, I was still working as an artist/ art director. I had some HTML/ CSS background and was learning JavaScript for a few months by then after work. But I had never completed any serious projects besides some static websites.

My progress before the bootcamp was rather spotty (evident from my blog posts and git commits). Some days I simply was too tired to study. Other days I felt paralyzed with anxiety. The days before I received news that I had passed the coding test, I had moments when I felt I wasn't prepared to take such a big leap, and had second thoughts about it.

Most of those anxiety vanished once I got in. There were certainly times I felt confused during the bootcamp. But realizing that others felt similarly and that there wasn't anything wrong with taking more time to understand a concept made learning more fun.



### Why programming?

I was influenced by research about career happiness as well as other resources, such as [80000](https://80000hours.org) hours, and waitbutwhy's [comic](https://waitbutwhy.com/2018/04/picking-career.html) on choosing a career. The tl;dr is that programming fulfills a lot of the criteria that I personally prioritize:

* Excellent job prospects (good compensation and career longevity)
* Autonomy and engaging work
* Opportunity to do good
* Open to candidates without degree
* Lots of resources available online

Other motivating factors:&#x20;

* Stories from [FCC](https://www.freecodecamp.org/stories) and other podcasts
* Support from the community (MeetUp groups) and friends
* Boss offered to retain my position
* Lowered risks due to grants/ schemes

### &#x20;What helped?

### What I wish I knew

It's going to be okay:

* It's okay not to know a lot of things. Not even the most experienced programmers know all the programming concepts.
* It's okay not to have a CS degree or even a degree. Employers are willing to hire developers without them if they are good. You can take the time to learn CS concepts afterwards.
* It's okay if you can't understand something. It's probably not because you are stupid. Programming is tricky, and sometimes you just need a break.

Managing uncertainty:

* There's a mountain of things to learn and a myriad of paths. Don't worry about it too much if you've done your research and your current path is working for you. Pick one path and try to stick to it.
* You can't really predict how well you'll do in your programming career. Particularly if you don't fit with the stereotype.&#x20;

How to learn effectively:

* Don't be afraid to fail. It's just code. But it's best to have people to give you feedback so you don't repeat mistakes.
* Learn in public. It makes you accountable for your learning journey and mistakes.
* Learn GIT and how to use the command line sooner. Try to code or learn something every day. But remember to have time off. (Saturday is a break day for me.)

### Job Search Tips

(Some of them I didn't apply to my own search, but wish I had.)

* Proof-read your resume, and make sure to optimize it.
* Space out sending your resumes/ emails, so you don't get a bunch of coding assignments at one go.
* Networking helps. Go to MeetUps, meet more people and tell people you are looking for a job. You can get an introduction that way.
* Do daily coding katas and whiteboard them. Watch how others do their interviews (YouTube has quite a few).
* Learn your algorithms and data structures. Try to apply that knowledge to your katas.
* It's better to negotiate for a higher amount because the worst that can happen is usually a counter-offer.
* Consider a job search as an [optimal stopping problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary\_problem) if you have trouble deciding.
