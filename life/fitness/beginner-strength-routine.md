### Barbell Strength Training

The program itself is very straightforward. You alternate between **Workout A** and **Workout B**, leaving one full day of rest between each day of lifting. This is typically three days a week \(ie, Mon / Wed / Fri\) because it’s easier to schedule, but can also be done A-&gt;Rest-&gt;B-&gt;Rest-&gt;Repeat if your schedule allows.

**Workout A**

* 3×5+ Barbell Rows
* 3×5+ Bench Press
* 3×5+ Squats

**Workout B**

* 3×5+ Chinups \(or equivalent\)
* 3×5+ Overhead Press
* 3×5+ Deadlifts

You do all sets of one lift, then move on to the next.

The notation here is [Sets x Reps](http://thefitness.wiki/glossary/) – three sets of five reps. The “+” at the end denotes that the last set is AMRAP – As Many Reps As Possible.

The last set should not be to absolute muscular failure – try to get a feel for when you have 1-2 reps left in you. A good way to gauge when to stop is when your form breaks down or the speed of the bar slows significantly compared to the previous reps. You want these to be crisp, quality reps. Taking time to learn what real failure feels like and how to find this stopping point is one of the purposes of this routine.

Rest 2-3 minutes between each set, depending on how you feel. You can rest up to 5 minutes between exercises.

#### Progression

* Add 2.5 lbs to the upper body lifts \(Bench, Overhead Press, Row, Chinup\) each day you do the lift.
* Add 5 lbs to the lower body lifts \(Squat, Deadlift\) each day you do the lift.
* This weight is added to the **total** weight of the lift – not to each side.
* If you do more than 10 reps on your AMRAP set, double the weight progression and add 5/10lbs instead.
* If you fail to complete at least 15 total reps for a lift, deload by subtracting 10% from the weight the next time you do that lift. Use this time to set new rep records at past weights.

### Cardio and Conditioning

In addition to the barbell strength training, you will also do a minimum of two days a week of cardio and conditioning work.

* One day of lower intensity. Your options are things like brisk walks, jogging, light cycling, elliptical machines, and so on. This should be something you can sustain for 15-30 minutes at a time.
* One day of higher intensity. Your options are things like High Intensity Interval Training \(HIIT\), Tabata, circuits, or most things you find on our [Cardio and Conditioning](https://thefitness.wiki/routines/cardio-and-conditioning/) page. This should be something that is relatively hard that you definitely can’t do for very long. 10-15 minutes is usually plenty if done right.

This part of the routine is very, very flexible so don’t overthink your choices here. The specifics of what you do are much less important than that you’re simply doing the work.

You can do your cardio and conditioning work on any day of the week. If you do it on the same day you are lifting weights, it’s best to do it _after_ the lifting – otherwise it will likely tire you out some and your performance in the lifting may suffer.
