executables in bin folder when compiled

one comment min per package, with

// package\_name does what

&#x20;pkg names should be single words, lowercased

Another convention is that the package name is the base name of its source directory; the package in `src/encoding/base64` is imported as `"encoding/base64"` but has name `base64`, not `encoding_base64` and not `encodingBase64`.

The importer of a package will use the name to refer to its contents, so exported names in the package can use that fact to avoid repetition. (Don't use the `import .` notation, which can simplify tests that must run outside the package they are testing, but should otherwise be avoided.) For instance, the buffered reader type in the `bufio` package is called `Reader`, not `BufReader`, because users see it as `bufio.Reader`, which is a clear, concise name. Moreover, because imported entities are always addressed with their package name, `bufio.Reader` does not conflict with `io.Reader`. Similarly, the function to make new instances of `ring.Ring`—which is the definition of a _constructor_ in Go—would normally be called `NewRing`, but since `Ring` is the only type exported by the package, and since the package is called `ring`, it's called just `New`, which clients of the package see as `ring.New`. Use the package structure to help you choose good names.

Another short example is `once.Do`; `once.Do(setup)` reads well and would not be improved by writing `once.DoOrWaitUntilDone(setup)`. Long names don't automatically make things more readable. A helpful doc comment can often be more valuable than an extra long name.

```
owner := obj.Owner()
if owner != user {
    obj.SetOwner(user)
}
```



Getters

Go doesn't provide automatic support for getters and setters. There's nothing wrong with providing getters and setters yourself, and it's often appropriate to do so, but it's neither idiomatic nor necessary to put `Get` into the getter's name. If you have a field called `owner` (lower case, unexported), the getter method should be called `Owner` (upper case, exported), not `GetOwner`. The use of upper-case names for export provides the hook to discriminate the field from the method. A setter function, if needed, will likely be called `SetOwner`. Both names read well in practice:

#### Interface names <a href="#interface-names" id="interface-names"></a>

By convention, one-method interfaces are named by the method name plus an -er suffix or similar modification to construct an agent noun: `Reader`, `Writer`, `Formatter`, `CloseNotifier` etc.

There are a number of such names and it's productive to honor them and the function names they capture. `Read`, `Write`, `Close`, `Flush`, `String` and so on have canonical signatures and meanings. To avoid confusion, don't give your method one of those names unless it has the same signature and meaning. Conversely, if your type implements a method with the same meaning as a method on a well-known type, give it the same name and signature; call your string-converter method `String` not `ToString`.

\
Control structures

The control structures of Go are related to those of C but differ in important ways. There is no `do` or `while` loop, only a slightly generalized `for`; `switch` is more flexible; `if` and `switch` accept an optional initialization statement like that of `for`; `break` and `continue` statements take an optional label to identify what to break or continue; and there are new control structures including a type switch and a multiway communications multiplexer, `select`. The syntax is also slightly different: there are no parentheses and the bodies must always be brace-delimited.

```
f, err := os.Open(name)
if err != nil {
    return err
}
codeUsing(f)
```

In the Go libraries, you'll find that when an `if` statement doesn't flow into the next statement—that is, the body ends in `break`, `continue`, `goto`, or `return`—the unnecessary `else` is omitted.

#### Redeclaration and reassignment <a href="#redeclaration" id="redeclaration"></a>

An aside: The last example in the previous section demonstrates a detail of how the `:=` short declaration form works. The declaration that calls `os.Open` reads,

```
f, err := os.Open(name)
```

This statement declares two variables, `f` and `err`. A few lines later, the call to `f.Stat` reads,

```
d, err := f.Stat()
```

which looks as if it declares `d` and `err`. Notice, though, that `err` appears in both statements. This duplication is legal: `err` is declared by the first statement, but only _re-assigned_ in the second. This means that the call to `f.Stat` uses the existing `err` variable declared above, and just gives it a new value.

It's worth noting here that in Go the scope of function parameters and return values is the same as the function body, even though they appear lexically outside the braces that enclose the body.\
\
For strings, the `range` does more work for you, breaking out individual Unicode code points by parsing the UTF-8. Erroneous encodings consume one byte and produce the replacement rune U+FFFD. (The name (with associated builtin type) `rune` is Go terminology for a single Unicode code point. See [the language specification](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Rune\_literals) for details.) The loop

```
for pos, char := range "日本\x80語" { // \x80 is an illegal UTF-8 encoding
    fmt.Printf("character %#U starts at byte position %d\n", char, pos)
}
```

prints

```
character U+65E5 '日' starts at byte position 0
character U+672C '本' starts at byte position 3
character U+FFFD '�' starts at byte position 6
character U+8A9E '語' starts at byte position 7
```

\
Finally, Go has no comma operator and `++` and `--` are statements not expressions. Thus if you want to run multiple variables in a `for` you should use parallel assignment (although that precludes `++` and `--`).

```
// Reverse a
for i, j := 0, len(a)-1; i < j; i, j = i+1, j-1 {
    a[i], a[j] = a[j], a[i]
}
```

\
Switch

Go's `switch` is more general than C's. The expressions need not be constants or even integers, the cases are evaluated top to bottom until a match is found, and if the `switch` has no expression it switches on `true`. It's therefore possible—and idiomatic—to write an `if`-`else`-`if`-`else` chain as a `switch`.

```
func unhex(c byte) byte {
    switch {
    case '0' <= c && c <= '9':
        return c - '0'
    case 'a' <= c && c <= 'f':
        return c - 'a' + 10
    case 'A' <= c && c <= 'F':
        return c - 'A' + 10
    }
    return 0
}
```

There is no automatic fall through, but cases can be presented in comma-separated lists.

```
func shouldEscape(c byte) bool {
    switch c {
    case ' ', '?', '&', '=', '#', '+', '%':
        return true
    }
    return false
}
```

\
Although they are not nearly as common in Go as some other C-like languages, `break` statements can be used to terminate a `switch` early. Sometimes, though, it's necessary to break out of a surrounding loop, not the switch, and in Go that can be accomplished by putting a label on the loop and "breaking" to that label. This example shows both uses.

```
Loop:
	for n := 0; n < len(src); n += size {
		switch {
		case src[n] < sizeOne:
			if validateOnly {
				break
			}
			size = 1
			update(src[n])

		case src[n] < sizeTwo:
			if n+1 >= len(src) {
				err = errShortInput
				break Loop
			}
			if validateOnly {
				break
			}
			size = 2
			update(src[n] + src[n+1]<<shift)
		}
	}
```

\
Let's talk about `new` first. It's a built-in function that allocates memory, but unlike its namesakes in some other languages it does not _initialize_ the memory, it only _zeros_ it. That is, `new(T)` allocates zeroed storage for a new item of type `T` and returns its address, a value of type `*T`. In Go terminology, it returns a pointer to a newly allocated zero value of type `T`.

Constructors and composite literals

Sometimes the zero value isn't good enough and an initializing constructor is necessary, as in this example derived from package `os`.

```
func NewFile(fd int, name string) *File {
    if fd < 0 {
        return nil
    }
    f := new(File)
    f.fd = fd
    f.name = name
    f.dirinfo = nil
    f.nepipe = 0
    return f
}
```

There's a lot of boiler plate in there. We can simplify it using a _composite literal_, which is an expression that creates a new instance each time it is evaluated.

```
func NewFile(fd int, name string) *File {
    if fd < 0 {
        return nil
    }
    f := File{fd, name, nil, 0}
    return &f
}
```

Allocation with `make`

Back to allocation. The built-in function `make(T,` _args_`)` serves a purpose different from `new(T)`. It creates slices, maps, and channels only, and it returns an _initialized_ (not _zeroed_) value of type `T` (not `*T`). The reason for the distinction is that these three types represent, under the covers, references to data structures that must be initialized before use. A slice, for example, is a three-item descriptor containing a pointer to the data (inside an array), the length, and the capacity, and until those items are initialized, the slice is `nil`. For slices, maps, and channels, `make` initializes the internal data structure and prepares the value for use. For instance,

```
make([]int, 10, 100)
```

allocates an array of 100 ints and then creates a slice structure with length 10 and a capacity of 100 pointing at the first 10 elements of the array. (When making a slice, the capacity can be omitted; see the section on slices for more information.) In contrast, `new([]int)` returns a pointer to a newly allocated, zeroed slice structure, that is, a pointer to a `nil` slice value.

\
\


But even this style isn't idiomatic Go. Use slices instead.

```
func Sum(a *[3]float64) (sum float64) {
    for _, v := range *a {
        sum += v
    }
    return
}

array := [...]float64{7.0, 8.5, 9.1}
x := Sum(&array)  // Note the explicit address-of operator
```

The value property can be useful but also expensive; if you want C-like behavior and efficiency, you can pass a pointer to the array.

* Arrays are values. Assigning one array to another copies all the elements.
* In particular, if you pass an array to a function, it will receive a _copy_ of the array, not a pointer to it.
* The size of an array is part of its type. The types `[10]int` and `[20]int` are distinct.

Sometimes it's necessary to allocate a 2D slice, a situation that can arise when processing scan lines of pixels, for instance. There are two ways to achieve this. One is to allocate each slice independently; the other is to allocate a single array and point the individual slices into it. Which to use depends on your application. If the slices might grow or shrink, they should be allocated independently to avoid overwriting the next line; if not, it can be more efficient to construct the object with a single allocation. For reference, here are sketches of the two methods. First, a line at a time:

```
// Allocate the top-level slice.
picture := make([][]uint8, YSize) // One row per unit of y.
// Loop over the rows, allocating the slice for each row.
for i := range picture {
	picture[i] = make([]uint8, XSize)
}
```

And now as one allocation, sliced into lines:

```
// Allocate the top-level slice, the same as before.
picture := make([][]uint8, YSize) // One row per unit of y.
// Allocate one large slice to hold all the pixels.
pixels := make([]uint8, XSize*YSize) // Has type []uint8 even though picture is [][]uint8.
// Loop over the rows, slicing each row from the front of the remaining pixels slice.
for i := range picture {
	picture[i], pixels = pixels[:XSize], pixels[XSize:]
}
```

\
Maps

Maps are a convenient and powerful built-in data structure that associate values of one type (the _key_) with values of another type (the _element_ or _value_). The key can be of any type for which the equality operator is defined, such as integers, floating point and complex numbers, strings, pointers, interfaces (as long as the dynamic type supports equality), structs and arrays. Slices cannot be used as map keys, because equality is not defined on them. Like slices, maps hold references to an underlying data structure. If you pass a map to a function that changes the contents of the map, the changes will be visible in the caller.

Maps can be constructed using the usual composite literal syntax with colon-separated key-value pairs, so it's easy to build them during initialization.

```
var timeZone = map[string]int{
    "UTC":  0*60*60,
    "EST": -5*60*60,
    "CST": -6*60*60,
    "MST": -7*60*60,
    "PST": -8*60*60,
}
```

\
append

But what if we wanted to do what our `Append` does and append a slice to a slice? Easy: use `...` at the call site, just as we did in the call to `Output` above. This snippet produces identical output to the one above.

```
x := []int{1,2,3}
y := []int{4,5,6}
x = append(x, y...)
fmt.Println(x)
```

Without that `...`, it wouldn't compile because the types would be wrong; `y` is not of type `int`.

\
constants

Constants in Go are just that—constant. They are created at compile time, even when defined as locals in functions, and can only be numbers, characters (runes), strings or booleans. Because of the compile-time restriction, the expressions that define them must be constant expressions, evaluatable by the compiler. For instance, `1<<3` is a constant expression, while `math.Sin(math.Pi/4)` is not because the function call to `math.Sin` needs to happen at run time.\


```
type Stringer interface {
    String() string
}

var value interface{} // Value provided by caller.
switch str := value.(type) {
case string:
    return str
case Stringer:
    return str.String()
}
```

#### Interface conversions and type assertions <a href="#interface_conversions" id="interface_conversions"></a>

[Type switches](https://go.dev/doc/effective\_go#type\_switch) are a form of conversion: they take an interface and, for each case in the switch, in a sense convert it to the type of that case. Here's a simplified version of how the code under `fmt.Printf` turns a value into a string using a type switch. If it's already a string, we want the actual string value held by the interface, while if it has a `String` method we want the result of calling the method.

#### &#x20;<a href="#interface_conversions" id="interface_conversions"></a>

Generality

If a type exists only to implement an interface and will never have exported methods beyond that interface, there is no need to export the type itself. Exporting just the interface makes it clear the value has no interesting behavior beyond what is described in the interface. It also avoids the need to repeat the documentation on every instance of a common method.

In such cases, the constructor should return an interface value rather than the implementing type. As an example, in the hash libraries both `crc32.NewIEEE` and `adler32.New` return the interface type `hash.Hash32`. Substituting the CRC-32 algorithm for Adler-32 in a Go program requires only changing the constructor call; the rest of the code is unaffected by the change of algorithm.\
\


```
// Bad! This code will crash if path does not exist.
fi, _ := os.Stat(path)
if fi.IsDir() {
    fmt.Printf("%s is a directory\n", path)
}
```

Occasionally you'll see code that discards the error value in order to ignore the error; this is terrible practice. Always check error returns; they're provided for a reason.

Interface checks

As we saw in the discussion of [interfaces](https://go.dev/doc/effective\_go#interfaces\_and\_types) above, a type need not declare explicitly that it implements an interface. Instead, a type implements the interface just by implementing the interface's methods. In practice, most interface conversions are static and therefore checked at compile time. For example, passing an `*os.File` to a function expecting an `io.Reader` will not compile unless `*os.File` implements the `io.Reader` interface.



### Embedding <a href="#embedding" id="embedding"></a>

Go does not provide the typical, type-driven notion of subclassing, but it does have the ability to “borrow” pieces of an implementation by _embedding_ types within a struct or interface.

Interface embedding is very simple. We've mentioned the `io.Reader` and `io.Writer` interfaces before; here are their definitions.

```
type Reader interface {
    Read(p []byte) (n int, err error)
}

type Writer interface {
    Write(p []byte) (n int, err error)
}
```

The `io` package also exports several other interfaces that specify objects that can implement several such methods. For instance, there is `io.ReadWriter`, an interface containing both `Read` and `Write`. We could specify `io.ReadWriter` by listing the two methods explicitly, but it's easier and more evocative to embed the two interfaces to form the new one, like this:

```
// ReadWriter is the interface that combines the Reader and Writer interfaces.
type ReadWriter interface {
    Reader
    Writer
}
```
