# Women in Tech

#### Imposter Syndrome

There's no evidence of women being predisposed to be worse at STEM, based on [25 years of research](https://www.vox.com/2017/8/11/16127992/google-engineer-memo-research-science-women-biology-tech-james-damore). And yet we still have stuff like the [Google memo](https://gizmodo.com/exclusive-heres-the-full-10-page-anti-diversity-screed-1797564320) that perpetuate this stereotype. I find the biggest challenge to learning or getting into an industry is overcoming internalized bias. 

I'm still new as a developer, so it's also challenging to differentiate the lack of confidence based on being a newbie versus my own bias.

I am fortunate to have devs around me who are fair but supportive, who I can turn to when I need a honest critique. Meetup groups and online groups are a great way to find dev friends. 

It's also nice to have peers/ colleagues to exchange notes on your developer journey, as those notes serve as a barometer to measure your progress by.

#### Fake it till you make it

'Fake it till you make it' has negative connotations in the age of Anna Sorokin and Frank Abagnale. But I personally subscribe to the ['acting as if'](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/what-mentally-strong-people-dont-do/201606/when-fake-it-till-you-make-it-and-when-you-shouldnt) part of it, where you push yourself out of your comfort zone to better yourself.

That sometimes means failure. But failure is a good teacher, if you can recover and learn from it.



#### Harassment

Most people are nice. But encountering bullshit \(including but not limited to: sexism or harassment\) is inevitable. In an ideal scenario, you make your stand, and the situation is remedied. But the real world is complex, and it's doubly difficult if you are in the minority. I found [This American Life's episode](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/647/ladonna) of a how a security guard handled sexism interesting. \([Transcript](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/647/transcript) here\) 

In the story, she went hard against the system. She won some battles, and lost some. What I got out of it though, is that YMMV. While it's important to advocate for yourself \(and others\), you may have to pick your battles. It's also important to be empathetic and recognize that different women have varying responses.
