# Women in Tech

#### Imposter Syndrome

There's no evidence of women being predisposed to be worse at STEM, based on [25 years of research](https://www.vox.com/2017/8/11/16127992/google-engineer-memo-research-science-women-biology-tech-james-damore). And yet we still have stuff like the [Google memo](https://gizmodo.com/exclusive-heres-the-full-10-page-anti-diversity-screed-1797564320) that perpetuate this stereotype. I find the biggest challenge to learning or getting into an industry is overcoming internalized bias. 

I'm still new as a developer, so it's also challenging to differentiate the lack of confidence based on being a newbie versus my own bias.

I am fortunate to have devs around me who are fair but supportive, who I can turn to when I need a honest critique. Meetup groups and online groups are a great way to find dev friends. 

It's also nice to have peers/ colleagues to exchange notes on your developer journey, as those notes serve as a barometer to measure your progress by.

#### Fake it till you make it

'Fake it till you make it' has negative connotations in the age of Anna Sorokin and Frank Abagnale. But I personally subscribe to the ['acting as if'](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/what-mentally-strong-people-dont-do/201606/when-fake-it-till-you-make-it-and-when-you-shouldnt) part of it, where you push yourself out of your comfort zone to better yourself.

That sometimes means failure. But failure is a good teacher, if you can recover and learn from it.
