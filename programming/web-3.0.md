# Web 3.0

TLDR:

Web 1.0 was static/ read-only.

Web 2.0 is interactive, aka social web. It has the issue of data-privacy.

Web 3.0 is semantic web (meaning AI can understand the meaning of web content)

Web 3.0 also includes Dapps to build applications on an open and decentralized architecture.





How? With the use of techs like Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain, 3D Graphics, Virtual Reality, and Augmented Reality.

With **AI**, we can better understand and interpret the content on the web.

With **blockchains**, we can use it to build applications on decentralized protocols where we remove trusted intermediaries​ and gain public verifiability. This way we're not stuck in this paradigm where everything on the internet is “walled gardens.”

We can use **cryptocurrency** to completely transform the business model of applications that exist on the internet, instead of the ad-based model that we have today.
