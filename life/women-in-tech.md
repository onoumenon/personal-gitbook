# Women in Tech

#### Women in Tech

Coding used to be pioneered by women, but there's been a shift in demographics. Planet Money has a good episode on [when \(and why\) women stopped coding](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2014/10/21/357629765/when-women-stopped-coding). 



#### Imposter Syndrome

There's no evidence of women being predisposed to be worse at STEM, based on [25 years of research](https://www.vox.com/2017/8/11/16127992/google-engineer-memo-research-science-women-biology-tech-james-damore). And yet, it's not too long since the [Google memo](https://gizmodo.com/exclusive-heres-the-full-10-page-anti-diversity-screed-1797564320) that continues to perpetuate this stereotype. I find the biggest challenge to learning or getting into an industry is overcoming internalized bias. 

If you are a junior developer, it's also challenging to differentiate your lack of confidence that is based on being a newbie versus internal bias.

Find women who are further along in their careers and ask them for advice. Meetup groups and online groups are a great way to find developer friends. 

It's also great to have peers/ colleagues to exchange notes on your developer journey, as those notes serve as a barometer to measure your progress by.
