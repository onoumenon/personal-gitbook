## Safety guidelines and Lab rules/ tips

Aromachemicals and essential oils are generally not safe to ingest/ touch undiluted

Keep away from warm temperatures, as there are some chemicals that may combust

Room-temp UHT milk to wash out oils \(from ingestion or eyes\)

Use foam-based fire extinguishers for flames

Store in air-tight containers in cool, dry place

Rubber teats are not air-tight
