# How to Learn

## Preface

> We are a way for the universe to know itself. Some part of our being knows this is where we came from. We long to return. And we can, because the cosmos is also within us. We're made of star-stuff.

>  **- Carl Sagan**

Like many others, I'm compelled to learn new things, but am not good at studying.

I've always thought I was bad at maths. I used to consistently fail my Maths exams in high school \(though I eventually eked out an A for the O levels after 'mugging' miserably for it\).

It was only in recent years, after watching YouTube channels such as Numberphile and Vihart, that I renewed an interest in mathematics. The creator of 'Learning How to Learn", Barbara Oakley, had an even more dramatic journey in mathematics. I highly recommend her course \(available for free on Coursera\).

Given how much time we invest in education, it's a waste that most of us \(including me\) were never taught how to learn. So step one is to [learn how to learn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd2dtkMINIw).

## The brain

> The human **brain** has 100 billion neurons, each neuron connected to 10,000 other neurons. Sitting on your shoulders is the **most complicated object** in the known **universe**.

All your learning hinges on your brain so it's best to know your equipment.

#### Neuroplasticity

The reality is a bit more complex. The brain is [malleable](https://sharpbrains.com/blog/2008/02/26/brain-plasticity-how-learning-changes-your-brain/), and learning alters your brain \(source: [London taxi drivers study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17024677)\).  Even brain damage can be reversed. It's therefore important to have a growth mindset and learn continuously. 

#### Fitness and mental health affects your mind.

 There's a page on fitness on this wiki, and there are resources available for maintaining good mental health. Here's my own mental health management strategy \(ordered in prioritization\):

* maintain good physical health
* manage stress and anxiety
* have meaningful social interactions
* meditation/ CBT/ medication \(if needed\)



#### Managing stress and anxiety

Most problems aren't worth worrying about. Instead of ruminating on them, just take the steps needed to remedy it, and do other things \(like watching cat videos\). I find it helpful to think about my problems from a third party observer's view. 

Take time away from obsessing about the problem with an outdoor activity.

Don't measure yourself based on your achievements, your job, or fame. A better measure would be how much you have learned and matured over the years. \(E.g.: How has your world view changed, and is it for the better? Do you know how to live independently? How are you as a friend or a child?\)  

Learn about cognitive biases and overcome them, so you can deal with life rationally. \(And avoid many pitfalls.\)



#### Expend less effort remembering useless things

Such as phone numbers, a meeting date, or your mom's birthday. There's a limit to our [memory](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/04/180426110502.htm), so go ahead and rely on your smartphone as a brain extension.

## Learn in public

 Swyx has a good [blog post](https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public/) on it, as well as links to other posts related to that topic. I like Coding Horror's post on "[How to stop sucking](https://blog.codinghorror.com/how-to-stop-sucking-and-be-awesome-instead/)" as well.

The TLDR of it is that you will learn faster learning in public. The internet is a great place to get feedback. You hold yourself accountable for having non-zero days \(learning something everyday\). 

I have a blog, and this gitbook to document what I've learned, as well as a public trello board for what I wish to learn. It takes time to document things, but I do find that it is easier to recall what I've learned if I were to write it down.
