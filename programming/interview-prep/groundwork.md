### Week 1 — Brush up on the basics of your favorite Programming language

Brush up on your chosen programming language. There are going to be a lot of things that you’ve forgotten when you have been coding for your day job even using your preferred language. I’ve seen people struggling to remember things like:

* How to read/write from/to files
* How to read input from the console
* How to split strings
* Is string length a function or a property? (Answer: it doesn’t matter, but still reflects poorly on you)
* How to declare and use 2D arrays
* In C/C++, how to handle null-terminated strings

### Week 4+5

**Brush up your array skills with questions like:**

* Remove Even Integers from Array
* Merge Two Sorted Arrays
* First Non-Repeating Integer in an Array
* Find Second Maximum Value in an Array

**Brush up your Linked List concepts with questions like:**

* Find Length of Linked List
* Search in Singly Linked List
* Reverse a Linked List
* Find Middle Value of Linked List

**Brush up your Stack/Queue skills with questions like:**

* Sort values in Stack
* Create Stack where `min()` returns minimum value in O(1)O(1)
* Implement Two Stacks using one Array

**Practice Tree Problems like:**

* Find minimum value in Binary Search Tree
* Find Height of Binary Tree
* Find kth maximum value in Binary Search Tree

**Practice Graph Problems:**

* Implement Breadth First Search
* Implement Depth First Search
* Detect cycle in Graph

**Practice basic Trie Problems:**

* Total number of words in Trie
* Find all words stored in Trie

**Practice basic Heap problems:**

* Find k smallest elements in a list
* Find k largest elements in an array



### Week 6, 7, 8

**Here are some guidelines to keep in mind as you solve these problems:**

1. Now is the time to start timing yourself. Ideally, you shouldn’t spend more than 20–30 minutes solving any given problem. _This probably won’t be possible for all questions right away._
2. Don’t be discouraged if you are not able to solve a problem within the allocated time. Solve it even if takes you a couple of hours, without looking at the solution. This will help you build the confidence that you can solve it and then you can focus on solving them faster later.
3. Start thinking about the Runtime and Memory complexity of each solution. You will have to articulate the complexities in the actual interview clearly, so it’s better to start now.

**Here are some sample problems to consider:**

* Implement Binary Search Find the Intersection point of two linked lists
* Reverse words in a sentence
* Check if two binary trees are identical
* Clone (deep copy) a directed graph
* Find solutions to a Boggle game
* Determine if there are any three integers in an array that sum equal to the given value.
