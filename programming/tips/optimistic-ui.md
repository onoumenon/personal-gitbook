# Optimistic UI

{% embed url="https://uxplanet.org/optimistic-1000-34d9eefe4c05?gi=bdb0b5b37a46" %}

The TLDR:

* Show users the final state even before the request is done
* Show progress/ status indicator (if relevant)
* When showing error to user, it should be salient
* What caused the error should be obvious to the user&#x20;
